# Quantum Whirl

Interactive Quantum Coinflip and Bloch Sphere visualization.

Features
- Visualize a single-qubit state on a Bloch sphere
- Adjust parameters (θ, φ, amplitudes, phase)
- Simulate a "quantum" coin flip with measurement probabilities
- Polished UI with particle background and interactive controls

How to run
- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click) for a quick run.
- For a local server (recommended), run one of the following in the project root:

  - With Python 3:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8080
```

  - With Node (no install required):

```powershell
npx http-server . -p 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
